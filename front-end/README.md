This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, we install all the necessary dependecies using `npm install` from the main folder of this front-end app. Afterwards we can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
> **Note**: DO NOT forget to start the back-end application as well.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Building the app ##
You can build the app by using `npm build` and then you can start the app by using `npm start`.
